# About
<h6>
  &emsp; The MXR Distortion Plus was considered the first commercially successful distortion pedals ever released. Known for it's aggressive "hard clipping" sound used by the likes of Randy Rhoads of Ozzy Osbourne, Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, Slash of Guns N Dave Murray of Iron Maiden,and countless more. The pedal is very simple with its two output and distortion controls only, making for a very easy setup.

## Circuit Diagram with Common Mods
Here are some common mods from Brian Wampler of Wampler Pedals, feel free to add mods to your design.
- Compression switch to add or decrease compression
- Change R3 and C3 to 1K and 0.22uF for more gain with similar tone
- Wire a toggle switch to add in 1N34A and 1N4001 clipping diodes for a smoother distortion sound
- Wire a six pin toggle switch to add 1n4001 diodes in series with 1N34A diodes for more volume and dynamics
- Change C5 to a 2.2nF capacitor and add a 1M audio taper potentiometer for a tone control
